    "\n",
    "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), can deal better with large images. Until now, images that we have used were fairly small. Imagine an color image with 500 x 500 pixels, this means you would    end up having 500 x 500 x 3 = 750,000 input features, $(x_1,...,x_{750,000})$. Next, imagine having 2000 hidden units in the first hidden layer. Then the matrix $w^{[1]}$ would have dimensions (2000 x 750,000), and will have 1.5 billion parameters. So it becomes a very high-dimensional problem!\n",

    "    - Unlike with densely connected networks, when a convolutional neural network recognizes a patterns let's say, in the upper-right corner of a picture, it can recognize it anywhere else in a picture. \n",
    "    - Deeper convolutional neural networks can learn spatial hierarchies. A first layer will learn small local patterns, a second layer will learn larger patterns using features of the first layer patterns, etc. \n",

This particular filter operation will detect horizontal edges. The matrix in the left should have number in it (from 1-255, or let's assume we rescaled it to number 1-10). The output is a 3 x 3 matrix. (*This example is for computational clarity, no clear edges*)\n",

    "    - Starting from a 5 x 5 matrix, and using a 3 x 3 matrix, you end up with a 3 x 3 image. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we apply 3x3 filters to a 5x5 image, our original 5x5 image contains 25 pixels, but tiling our 3x3 filter only has 9 possible locations. Here's the 4 of the 9 possible locations for the 3x3 filter on a 5x5 image:  \n",

In our above example, we moved the filter one pixel to the right starting from the upper left hand corner, and then began to do this again after moving the filter one pixel down. Alternatively, by changing the stride, we could move our filter by 2 pixels each time, resulting in a smaller number of possible locations for the filter.  \n",

This layer is meant to substantially downsample the previous convolutional layers. The idea behind this is that the previous convolutional layers will find patterns such as edges or other basic shapes present in the pictures. From there, pooling layers such as Max pooling (the most common) will take a summary of the convolutions from a larger section. In practice Max pooling (taking the max of all convolutions from a larger area of the original image) works better then average pooling as we are typically looking to detect whether a feature is present in that region. Downsampling is essential in order to produce viable execution times in the model training."
